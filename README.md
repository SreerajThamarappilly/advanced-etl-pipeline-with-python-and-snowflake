# advanced-etl-pipeline-with-python-and-snowflake

## Architecture Overview

This project implements an advanced ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and Snowflake. The architecture involves:

1. **Data Ingestion (Extract):** 
   - Data is fetched from external sources (e.g., a public API).
   
2. **Transformation:**
   - Data is cleaned, filtered, and transformed into a suitable format.
   
3. **Loading into Snowflake:**
   - The transformed data is inserted into Snowflake tables for analytics and business intelligence.
   
4. **API Layer (FastAPI):**
   - Provides RESTful endpoints to trigger ETL jobs, view ETL status, and integrate with other services.
   
5. **Scalability and Reliability:**
   - The system is designed using OOP principles and design patterns (Strategy, Factory) to handle multiple data sources and transformations.
   - Environment variables and configuration files ensure easy scaling and secure credential management.
   
6. **Advanced Concepts:**
   - Uses Python best practices, logging, and exception handling.
   - Incorporates concepts from the CAP theorem, ensuring eventual consistency through idempotent ETL runs.
   - Designed for high availability and horizontal scaling to handle millions of concurrent requests.

## Technologies and Concepts Used

- **Programming Languages & Frameworks:**
  - Python (3.10+)
  - FastAPI (for building the RESTful API)
  - SQLAlchemy (for database interactions)
  
- **Databases & Data Warehousing:**
  - Snowflake (data warehousing)
  - PostgreSQL (optional for local metadata store if needed)
  
- **Data Engineering & ETL:**
  - Custom ETL workflows orchestrated via Python classes and methods.
  - OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
  - Python Design Patterns (Strategy Pattern for different extractors, Factory Pattern for ETL components)
  
- **Other Concepts:**
  - Environment Variables for secrets and configuration.
  - Docker & Docker Compose for containerized deployment.
  - Unit tests and integration tests using `pytest`.
  - Logging and error handling.
  - Secure credential handling (no hardcoding secrets).
  - CI/CD integration points (not shown, but the structure supports it).
